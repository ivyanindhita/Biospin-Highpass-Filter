**The inverse Fourier Transform is:**

Fourier Transform decomposes an image into its real and imaginary components which is a representation of the image in the frequency domain. If the input signal is an image then the number of frequencies in the frequency domain is equal to the number of pixels in the image or spatial domain. The inverse transform re-transforms the frequencies to the image in the spatial domain. 

## Analysis Of Signal 
**1. Signal X**

code:

x = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 586 * t) 

plt.plot(t,x)

**analysis** : From the equation signal x produces a signal that has a slightly tenuous wave, because the signal frequency x is smaller

**2. Signal Y**

Code: 

y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 863 * t)
plt.plot(t,y)

**analysis** : From the equation, a signal that produces a signal that has a dense wave. because the signal frequency y is large

**3. Signal Z**

Code:

z = x+y

plt.plot(t,z)

**analysis** : if we combine the two signals, a z signal is formed which is a combination of signal x and signal y

## The Audio Result with Z Audio

Code:

Audio(z, rate = fs)

**Analysis** : From the results of the z equation, that the sound produced is loud, noisy, and not pitched. This happens because the shape of the signal is generated by combining the x signal and the y signal to produce noise.
