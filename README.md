# Biospin-Highpass-Filter
contains the source code high pass filter at 586 Hz - 863 Hz

## Analysis of FFT with the FFT IFFT equation





## Analysis Of Signal 
1. Signal X

code > x = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 586 * t) 

plt.plot(t,x)

analysis : From the equation signal x produces a signal that has a slightly tenuous wave, because the signal frequency x is smaller
